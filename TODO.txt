- Curl slate info from DraftKings and assign game time to players_pool
- Automatically put latest window players in FLEX
- Late swap: generate top late swaps. I guess I only need a handful of options here:
 - the max projection, max chalk, and max projection with various ownership constraints
   (all maintaining at least a single stack I guess)

(0) New branch automation
(1) Download the day's contests json from s3
(2) Read DKEntries.csv into dataframe
(3) Look up each contest in contests.json using the 'Contest ID' (will be 'id' field in contests.json)
(4) These contests should all have the same value for "dg" -- this is the slate ID
(5) Download the players ('playables') for that slate -- {dg}.json from the same folder we got contests.json 
(6) Join number of entrants onto DKEntries dataframe ("m" field in contests.json)
  - 'num_entrants'
  - 'field_size_classification'
