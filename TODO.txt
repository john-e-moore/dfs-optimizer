- Curl slate info from DraftKings and assign game time to players_pool
- Automatically put latest window players in FLEX
- Late swap: generate top late swaps. I guess I only need a handful of options here:
 - the max projection, max chalk, and max projection with various ownership constraints
   (all maintaining at least a single stack I guess)
