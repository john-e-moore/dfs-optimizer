- Showdown
 - make a showdown-contests.yaml
 - start by constraining just weighted ownership. 
  - anchors: ~2500 player contests, sum ownership 140-170%. Up to 200.
  - 
 - extend diversification and full pipeline to handle showdown.


- Late swap: generate top late swaps. I guess I only need a handful of options here:
 - the max projection, max chalk, and max projection with various ownership constraints
   (all maintaining at least a single stack I guess)
